###Project for Getting and Cleaning Data

Student:	`Anthony Davidson`    Class:   `Getting and Cleaning Data-005`

##Scope of the project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 
1) a tidy data set as described below, 
2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.  

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.  Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

Good luck!

##Steps to reproduce this project

Open the R script **run_analysis.r** using a text editor.
Change the parameter of the setwd function call to the working directory (i.e., the folder where the R script files and the data is saved).
The files; **run_analysis.R**, **run_analysis.Rmd** and **makeCodebook.Rmd** will need to be in the working directory.
The folder **UCI HAR Dataset** which contains all the data, will also need to be in the working directory.
Run the R script `run_analysis.r`. It calls the R Markdown files, **run_analysis.Rmd** which contains most of the code and **makeCodebook.Rmd** which creates the required codebook.


##Resultant Files produced for Project

1. Tidy dataset file **TidyDataHumanActivityRecognitionUsingSmartphones.txt** (tab-delimited text),
2. Codebook file **codebook.md** (Markdown)
3. Note: **run_analysis.md** is also produced by the code. This was to help with verification during the trial and error programming stage.
    

##Subscript

The Codebook file **codebook.md** and **run_anlysis.md** have also been converted to html format for easier reviewing
